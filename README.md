A tool to replace all osu beatmap backgrounds at once.

You need to have python 3.6 or newer installed. That's it.

I have deliberately added delays between each step so that you guys know what all is happening and what you need to do ~~Plus it looks cool~~...

**Warning**: Not compatible with storyboards. In case the storyboard images of a map are in its root directory, they might get deletd and hence, cannot be recovered so you might have to download the map again.
