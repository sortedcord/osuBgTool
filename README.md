# OsuBgTool
A tool to replace all osu beatmap backgrounds at once.

### Requirements
You need to have python 3.6 or newer installed. That's it.

### How to Use
Just run the script with python

```PowerShell
C:\Windows\LOL> python main.py
```

I have deliberately added delays between each step so that you guys know what all is happening and what you need to do ~~Plus it looks cool~~...
